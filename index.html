            <h2>Welcome to Haunting History</h2>
            <p>At Haunting History, we believe that music has the power to tell stories, evoke emotions, and bring people together. It is a space where music is not just made, but it is felt—deeply and passionately.</p>
            <p>But we also believe in something just as important: Mental health matters. Music and mental health are deeply intertwined. Both can be a source of healing, expression, and understanding. Join us in embracing the power of sound, and understanding the importance of caring for your mental health along the way.</p>
